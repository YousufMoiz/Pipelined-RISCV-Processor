# Pipelined-RISCV-Processor
This was a project for my course 'Computer Architecture' in which we first designed and tested a single cycle RISC-V processor and then converted it to a pipelined one with complete hazard detection. At the moment, it supports only a subset of the RISC-V instructions which are add, addi, sub, beq, blt, ld and sd. The coding of the processor was done on Verilog and the processor was simulated on ModelSim.
This repository contains the codes for the pipelined and single cycle processor. The instruction memory of both these processors has bubble sort code preloaded which sorts the data in the data memory.
